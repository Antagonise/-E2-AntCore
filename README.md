# E2-AntCore
Extension for Wiremod Expression2

This repo just exists to save people effort/time decompiling the addon file to check the contents. Also a good host for documentation. The contents of the repo may not be up to date with the workshop depending on if I get lazy.


# Documentation

This extension exists to remove limitations on E2 without allowing it to be abused.

# Recent Changes

some recent changes (not only the latest changes):
* Changed RT cam spawn limit to be same as normal cameras, normally RT cams have no limit but i think this is nicer
* Fixed inflictor nil error in damage event (problem in other addons causes errors here)
* Disabled scale (phys and cosmetic model) on ragdolls
* Added gravity hull support (requires gravity hull addon)
* Added veh:ejectPodTemp(..) and ply:returnToPod()
* Added e:ctpEnabled()

# Abuse Prevention / Optimisation

# Functions

# General

# Base E2 Extension

# Players

# Offensive

# Weapons

# Vehicles

# Physics

# Wire spawning
This section exists as a big convenience. A lot of the time a feature is required that can be done by using a wire part, but then a simple E2 becomes a contraption which requires advanced duplicator to save/reproduce. This just removes that inconvenience.
